# qubic-miner-helper

### Helps to easy run multiple Qiner worker instances with same command line params.
#### Its now compatible with Qiner 0.4.1 and has auto restart on detected inactivity and on crashes / worker process close. 

- **Set your miner and Insert your ID, desired thread count and seconds until update into command line box.** 
- **Then click on save command line**
- You can start multiple workers with desired Qiner sub threads. (sounds confusing but check screenshot)
- Restarts specific threads automatically if thread did not respond within 1 minute
- Restarts specific threads automatically if they crash/exit
- Additional info: Last time Error found with thread and reduced by how much
- Overall Iterations/s display
- Overall Errors found since program start display
- Take care - if the tool crashes you might have zombie Qiner threads which you have to stop manually
- No Virus, no bullshit but no support also ðŸ™‚
